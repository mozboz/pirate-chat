# pirate-chat

Pulled these out of [here](https://github.com/PirateBox-Dev/PirateBoxScripts_Webserver/tree/master/piratebox/piratebox) to get a quick and easy to deploy chat and file upload app for use in small communities and temporary locations like workshops and conferences. 

## Config, setup

No dependencies - if there's python, these will run!

There's minimal config available without hacking on droopy.py, but what there is is in start-pirate-chat.sh. You should be able to unpack and run!

## Starting, stopping

Start with start-pirate-chat.sh, stop with stop-pirate-chat.sh . Obviously run both while cd = this directory

## Misc
I had problems running and viewing on localhost and other hosts on local network, worked fine on dedicated server w/ public domain name.

## Demo

There may or may not be an example running online here: http://s-1.com:8003/
