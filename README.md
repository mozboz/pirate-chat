# pirate-chat
extraction of the pirate box python scripts for chat and file upload

All config is in pirate-chat-and-upload.sh, edit it then run it.

I had problems running and viewing on localhost and other hosts on local network, worked fine on dedicated server w/ public domain name.

It will spawn 3 processes, the chat, the file server and the droopy front end, echo their pids and all output to stdout. To stop, manually kill the processes.
